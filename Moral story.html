        <h2>The Ant and the Dove:</h2>

    One hot day, an ant was searching for some water. After walking around 
    for some time, she came to a spring. To reach the spring, 
    she had to climb up a blade of grass. While making her way up, 
    she slipped and fell into the water.
    
    She could have drowned if a dove up a nearby tree had not seen her. 
    Seeing that the ant was in trouble, the dove quickly plucked a leaf and dropped 
    it into the water near the struggling ant. The ant moved towards the leaf and 
    climbed up onto it. 
    Soon, the leaf drifted to dry ground, and the ant jumped out. She was safe at last.
    
    Just at that time, a hunter nearby was about to throw his net over the dove, hoping 
    to trap it.
    
    Guessing what he was about to do, the ant quickly bit him on the heel. Feeling 
    the pain, the hunter dropped his net. The dove was quick to fly away to safety.
    
    One good turn begets.

        <h2>The Lion and the Mouse:</h2>

            Once when a lion, the king of the jungle, was asleep, 
            a little mouse began running up and down on him. 
            This soon awakened the lion, who placed his huge 
            paw on the mouse, and opened his big jaws to swallow him.
            
            "Pardon, O King!" cried the little mouse. "Forgive me this time. 
            I shall never repeat it and I shall never forget your kindness. 
            And who knows, I may be able to do you a good turn one of these days!"
            
            The lion was so tickled by the idea of the mouse being able to help 
            him that he lifted his paw and let him go.
            
            Sometime later, a few hunters captured the lion, and tied him to a 
            tree. After that they went in search of a wagon, to take him to the 
            zoo.
            
            Short StoriesJust then the little mouse happened to pass by. 
            On seeing the lion's plight, he ran up to him and gnawed away the 
            ropes that bound him, the king of the jungle.
            
            "Was I not right?" said the little mouse, very happy to help the lion.
            
            Moral: Small acts of kindness will be rewarded greatly.</p>

        <p style="font-size: large; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">

            Rama's family is very big. Rama is a hard worker and he is 
            the sole 
            bread winner of the family. He has three kids, two sons and a daughter. 
            He lives along with father and mother. Rama used to work too hard to 
            feed his family.
            
            He works for more than 16 hours a day. The kids cannot see him as he will 
            leave home early in the morning before they wake-up and reach home around 
            midnight when kids would sleep every day. The entire family eagerly wait 
            to spend quality time with him and the kids miss him so much.
            
            The children were too curious about Sundays as his father would spend 
            the entire day with them. Unfortunately, to meet the increasing household 
            expenses and educational expenses, Rama took a weekend job to work even on 
            Sundays. The kids were very shattered and even Rama's wife and parents too!
            
            The typical routine continued for several weeks and year passed. All the 
            hard work of Rama earned a lot of benefits and he was offered promotion 
            with attractive increment.
            
            The family moved to a new house, got better clothes and ate healthy foods. 
            However, as usual, Rama continues to earn more and more money. One day his 
            wife asked him 'why are you running for money? We can be happy with what we 
            have now.'
            
            Rama replied, 'I want to give the best available in the world to all of you 
            and want you to stay happy always.'
            
            Two years passed and Rama hardly spent time with his family. The children 
            yearned to have their father at home. Meanwhile, the sincere efforts of Rama 
            reaped him a fortune. He was offered partnership and share in profits. 
            He continued to earn more and more wealth.
            
            Now, Rama's family is one of the richest families in the city. They have 
            all the facilities and luxuries. Still, Rama's children strove to meet their 
            father as he was hardly seen at home.
            
            His children turned teens and they are no more kids. Now, Rama earned 
            enough wealth to provide a luxurious life to his next five generations.
            
            Rama's family went to their beach house to spend their vacation. His 
            daughter asked, 'Dad will you please spend one day at home and stay 
            with us here?'
            
            Rama replied, 'Yes darling, tomorrow for sure, I will join you for the 
            lunch and be with you all for next few days. I'm tired of work and need 
            refreshment!'
            
            The entire family became very happy.
            
            Unfortunately, the next day, none in Rama's family were alive as they were 
            washed out in Tsunami!
            
            Rama was too busy even to hear the news about Tsunami. When he tried to 
            reach his beach house, he saw sea and water everywhere and screamed for his 
            family, He could not even find the dead bodies of his family.
            
            He can never have them again, cannot even see them and even by paying millions 
            he cannot get them back to life!
            
            He remembered his wife's words, 'Why are you running for money? We can be happy 
            with what we have now.'
            
            Money can't buy everything!</p>
