        Old Man Love for his Wife

        Once in morning came an elderly gentleman in hospital. He came 
        to get his stitches removed from his thumb.
        
        A nurse came to attend him. Nurse checked his vitals and told him 
        to wait as it would be over an hour before doctor would be able 
        to see him. While attending old man nurse noticed that he seemed 
        to be in hurry.
        
        So nurse told him to wait but old man asked him to hurry if possible. 
        Seeing this nurse thought that she would evaluate his wounds and if 
        possible would take care of it instead of making him wait.
        
        On examining nurse found that wounds were healed, so nurse went to 
        get supplies and came back to old man and started redressing his wound.
        
        As they started talking nurse asked him, “Do you have any doctor’s 
        appointment as you seem to be in hurry..?”
        
        Old man replied, “No, i need to go to nursing home to eat breakfast 
        with my wife.”
        
        Nurse then asked about his wife and came to know that she had been 
        living in nursing home for while and was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease.
        
        As nurse finished dressing she said, “Would she worry if you get 
        there a bit late??”
        
        Old man replied, “No.. She no longer remember who i am and had not 
        recognized him in last five years..”
        
        Nurse was surprised and said, “She doesn’t recognize you yet you go 
        to have breakfast with her every morning?? Why??”
        
        Old man smiled and replied, “She doesn’t know me but i still know 
        who she is..”
        
        Moral:
        For Person in Love time, place or health nothing matter. What matter’s 
        is love and care for his/her Partner despite facing any kind of difficulties.

            Brother’s Love

In hospital, there was little girl who was suffering 
from a very rare and serious disease. She had little 
brother who was just 5 years old.

Her brother himself was suffering from same disease and 
miraculously he survived and had developed antibodies to 
combat that illness.

Doctors found that girls only chance of recovery is blood 
transfusion from her 5 years old brother.

Doctors knew it will be a long process and boy had to go through 
medical process for transfusion so they decided to ask him first 
and make him comfortable before going ahead with transfusion.

So a doctor went to little kid and asked him, “If you give your 
blood to your sister then she will be healthy again. Are you 
willing to give your blood to your sister??”

Kid hesitated for a while and then said, “Yes, I will do it. 
If it will save her..”

After the transfusion process started, boy was lying next to 
her sister’s bed smiling. slowly his smile faded and he looked 
up to doctor and asked in trembling voice, “Will i die right away??”

Boy misunderstood doctors when they asked him about giving blood 
to his sister.

Doctor looked at innocent boy and thought to himself, “Boy thought 
that he had to give all the blood to her sister and after that he 
will die and yet he agreed to give blood to her and gave up his life for her.”

Doctor went to boy and cleared what he had misunderstood.</p>

            Young Girl Love for Prince

In ancient china, It was tradition that if prince has to 
be married before he can become crowned emperor. There 
was a prince who was about to be crowned. So he needed to 
find a young woman whom he could trust and get married to.

Once there was a  who had to be crowned in few days so Prince 
decided to summon all the young women from his kingdom in 
order to find most worthy candidate.

There was an old lady who used to serve at palace. When heard 
the news she got sad because she knew her daughter nurtured a 
secret love for prince. After getting home she told her daughter 
about it. Her daughter decided that she would go to palace. 
Old lady got worried after knowing her decision.

Old lady said to her daughter, “What will you do there?? There 
will be all beautiful and rich girls from kingdom will be 
present there..”

Daughter replied, “Mother I know i won’t be chosen but it’s my 
only chance to spend time with prince and that makes me happy. 
I will go to palace tomorrow.”

Next day when young girl reached palace, she saw young women from 
all around kingdom were present there wearing beautiful cloths 
and jewelry, prepared to do anything to seize this opportunity to 
marry prince.

In presence of all members of court and girls prince announced a challenge.

He said, “I will give you each a seed. After six months time, young 
woman who brings me the loveliest flower will be my wife and future 
empress.”

All girls took seed and left. Poor young girl also took her seed and 
planted it in a pot. She nurtured and took care of it with love. She 
believed that her love is true and flower will grow as large as her love 
for prince.

Girl saw that no shoot appeared even after three months have passed and 
nothing had grown in her pot. Young girl consulted farmers, peasants but 
nothing happened. With each days he felt that her dream have moved father away.

At last six months were over and still nothing had grown in that pot. She 
knew she had no flower to show still she decided to go back to palace with 
that pot. She reached palace on final day.

On final day all court member and girls arrived. She saw that all other 
candidates had wonderful results and each one had lovely flower, she was 
the only one holding a flowerless pot.

Finally, prince entered courtroom and inspected all candidates pot and 
announced result. He chose Servant’s daughter poor young girl as his would 
be wife.

All other girls present there got angry and protested that she had nothing 
in her pot and prince had chosen someone who had not managed to grow anything 
at all.

Prince calmed them down and explained the reason.

Prince said, “This young woman was the only one who cultivated the flower that 
made her worthy of becoming the empress: the flower of honesty. All the seeds 
I handed out were sterile and nothing could ever have grown from them.”

Moral:
We should not feel Disappointed if Things doesn’t go Way we think it should be. 
We should have Confidence and Stay Honesty and True because Honesty is best Policy.</p>
