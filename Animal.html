        Elephant and Friends

        One day an elephant wandered into a forest in search of friends.
        He saw a monkey on a tree.
        "Will you be my friend?" asked the elephant.
        Replied the monkey, "You are too big. You can not swing from trees like me."
        Next, the elephant met a rabbit. He asked him to be his friends.
        But the rabbit said, "You are too big to play in my burrow!"
        Then the elephant met a frog.
        "Will you be my friend? He asked.
        "How can I?" asked the frog.
        "You are too big to leap about like me."
        The elephant was upset. He met a fox next.
        "Will you be my friend?" he asked the fox.
        The fox said, "Sorry, sir, you are too big."
        The next day, the elephant saw all the animals in the forest 
        running for their lives.
        The elephant asked them what the matter was.
        The bear replied, "There is a tier in the forest. He's trying to 
        gobble us all up!"
        The animals all ran away to hide.
        The elephant wondered what he could do to solve everyone in the forest.
        Meanwhile, the tiger kept eating up whoever he could find.
        The elephant walked up to the tiger and said, "Please, Mr. Tiger, do not eat 
        up these poor animals."
        "Mind your own business!" growled the tiger.
        The elephant has a no choice but to give the tiger a hefty kick.
        The frightened tiger ran for his life.
        The elephant ambled back into the forest to announce the good news to everyone.
        All the animals thanked the elephant.
        They said, "You are just the right size to be our friend."

            The Crane and The Snake

In a forest close to the river bank mere lived a crane with his wife. 
They were very unhappy. Every time the wife laid eggs in their nest, 
a big black cobra who lived in a hollow in the tree, would eat them up. 
The crane had a friend the crab. He went to his friend the crab and shared 
his misery. "I feel so hopeless....That sneaking thief has eaten our eggs 
again," complained the crane angrily.

"Don't worry," said the crab comfortingly. "You need not be hopeless when 
you have a friend like me. We will come up with a solution."

The crab sat to think of a plan. Suddenly he jumped up and rushed to the crane.

"Friend, I have a wonderful plan," said the crab and whispered something into 
the crane's car.

The crane flew back to his nest and told his wife all about the crab's plan. 
He was very excited.

"Are you sure this will work?" asked the wife.

"I hope we are not making a mistake. Think twice before going ahead with the plan."

But the crane was eager to try out the plan. The crane flew down to the river bank 
and began to fish. He caught several little fishes and went down to the hole in which 
a mongoose lived. He dropped a fish at the mouth of the hole. Then he took another 
fish and dropped it a little further away from the first one. Repeating this, he made 
a trail of fishes leading to the tree where his nest was.

The mongoose smelt the fish and came out of the hole. "Ah, a fish!" exclaimed the 
mongoose joyfully and quickly ate it up. He then followed the trail of fishes. As 
he neared the tree where the cranes and the snake lived, the trail ended. Finding 
no more fishes, he looked around.

Suddenly he came across the black cobra at the foot of the tree. Seeing the mongoose, 
the cobra fought for his life. Both fought for a long time and in the end the mongoose 
killed the snake. The cranes who were watching the fight from their nest sighed with relief.

The next day the mongoose began to follow the same trail hoping to find more food. 
When he came to the tree where the trail ended, he decided to climb the tree in search 
of food.

The cranes who were away at the river bank returned to find the mongoose climbing down 
the tree. On looking in their nest, they discovered that this time, the mongoose had 
eaten up all their eggs.

"Alas! We got rid of one enemy only to find another," said the crane to his wife.</p>

        <h2>The Tortoise and the Hare</h2>
    <pre>

            The Tortoise and the Hare

Once upon a time, in the woods in the northern area of Pakistan, there 
lived many different kinds of animals. This area is famous for high 
mountains and very dense forests, and for hundreds of years these animals 
lived side by side as friends and helped one another in times of need and 
difficulty.

Sometimes the big bear liked to dance, and all of the animals would get 
together to see his magnificent performance. The Langoors (long tailed monkeys) 
would hang upside-down from the branches by their long tails. The elephants 
would use their long trunks to pick apples and peaches and apricots from the 
trees and share them among their friends. The snakes, with their beautifully 
patterned skin, would wrap themselves around the trunks and branches of the 
trees like brightly coloured banners. And the birds would sing beautiful songs 
while the hare used the shell of the tortoise to beat out a rhythm on his drum.

Often, by popular request, the proud peacock would display his colourful tail 
feathers behind him in the shape of a huge fan and begin a graceful dance that 
would last for many hours. All of the animals would clap and cheer at this 
impressive display.

One day, after just such a performance by the bear and the peacock, the young 
hare became jealous that he was not being praised in such a way. He wanted to 
show all of the animals that he too could do something impressive. The fact 
that he was being ignored made the hare quite ill tempered. He even began 
teasing the tortoise. ‘How slow and almost dead you are,’ said the hare. 
‘The only thing that you are useful for is as a stick for my drum.’

The tortoise did not like being teased in this way and said, ‘You are not 
being fair. I can do things too!’

‘What things?’ replied the hare. ‘You are simply too slow to do anything. 
If there was a fire you would even be too slow to escape and so you would perish in 
the flames.’

The tortoise, always so patient and kind, did not like being ridiculed by the hare 
and was tired of his friend always bragging about how fast he could run. 
‘I can escape from danger just as well as you,’ said the old tortoise. ‘I could 
even compete with you in a race,’ he announced.

The hare was astonished at such a challenge. ‘You!’ he exclaimed. ‘You would like 
to race with me?  Ha, Ha, Ha!’ The hare laughed so much that he fell off the rock 
that he was sitting on and collapsed onto the ground.

When the hare finally dragged himself up from the ground, he looked at the tortoise 
once more with a smug grin on his face. ‘And I suppose you would win this race?’ 
he asked. ‘Are you sure you are not dreaming?’ And with that, he began laughing some more.

The tortoise was very annoyed with the conceited hare. ‘Who are you to make assumptions 
and doubt my determination?’ he asked.

‘Ok, Ok,’ conceded the hare. ‘We will have a race!’

All of the animals had been listening to the tortoise and the hare and they all 
agreed that the race would take place the following morning at sunrise.

The following morning arrived and the tortoise made his way to the clearing in 
the forest where the race would begin.

The finish line was at the foot of the nearest hills where the wise owl sat 
watching over the racetrack with his yellow flag. He was the referee and his 
decision would be final. The chattering parrot was given the duty of announcing 
the start of the race, and the hare suggested that whoever lost the race would 
invite all of the animals to a tasty dinner. The tortoise agreed reluctantly. 
Now that he was actually going to have to race, he was not at all sure that he 
would be able to win against the speedy hare.

Both the hare and the tortoise stood at the start line with the other animals 
standing here and there along the sides of the racetrack. The parrot called 
out in his shrill voice: ‘On your marks, get ready, steady… one, two, three, go!’

The hare immediately skipped and hopped from the start line and in seconds 
reached a tree several metres away. He sat beneath the tree and looked back 
at the tortoise who had only managed to move a couple of inches from the starting 
line. ‘Oh, I can’t stand this pitiful sight,’ the hare said to himself. ‘I think 
I will go and pull out some carrots from the field and have my breakfast while 
I am waiting for the old tortoise to catch up.’

And so the hare ran to the small field next to the clearing and pulled up some carrots. 
After munching several of the juicy carrots, the hare began to feel very sleepy. He 
yawned and looked over towards the racetrack in the clearing. The tortoise was so slow 
that he had not moved far from his original position. ‘What a silly old nutcase,’ the 
hare said contemptuously. ‘That tortoise is so slow that I think I will have a little 
sleep before continuing with the race.’

And so the hare drifted off to sleep in the field. He was so sure he would win the race 
that he even began dreaming about his victory. He dreamt that all of the animals of the 
forest were standing along the sides of the racetrack cheering him along and waving their 
little flags as he flashed across the finish line with the old tortoise far behind.

Meanwhile, the tortoise continued at his steady pace along the racetrack, eventually 
passing the lazy hare who was still sleeping in the field. ‘Have a good rest, hare,’ 
thought the patient tortoise. ‘I will see you at the finish line.’

The tortoise smiled to himself and carried on his slow and steady progress until he 
eventually crossed over the finish line to win the race!

Once the wise owl had declared the tortoise the winner, the old tortoise hid himself 
behind a small rock and waited for the hare to arrive.

Sometime later, the hare eventually woke from his sleep and immediately began the 
race again, assuming that the slow tortoise was still far behind. In no time at all, 
the hare zoomed across the finish and fell to the ground with a thud. ‘Hooray, hooray!’ 
exclaimed the hare. ‘I’ve won, I’ve won!’

It was then that the tortoise raised his head from behind the rock. ‘Not really,’ he 
said in his gentle voice. ‘I am afraid I have already won the race.’

‘How did you get here?’ the hare asked in amazement.

‘Just like you did,’ replied the tortoise. ‘I came along the racetrack as quickly as 
my old feet would carry me.’

‘But you are very slow and I am very fast!’ exclaimed the hare.

‘That may be, but I have won the race. Isn’t that right, Mr Wise Owl?’

‘Yes indeed,’ said the owl. ‘You are the winner and the hare is the loser.’

‘This is not fair!’ cried the hare, barely disguising the anger in his voice. ‘We should 
repeat the race and this time I will show you!’

The wise owl approached the hare. ‘This is your punishment for being so arrogant and 
always thinking that you are better than others,’ he said. ‘That was your first mistake.’

‘But I was winning, you could see!’ exclaimed the hare. ‘If I had not gone to sleep along 
the way, this old tortoise would never have won the race!’

‘And that was your second mistake,’ declared the wise owl. ‘You were irresponsible and you 
fell asleep before the job was done.’

‘Well,’ said the hare, ‘I think the tortoise should be the one to cook for us all as he won 
the race and it is he who should be the host of the dinner, not me.’

Upon hearing these words, the owl looked very sternly at the cheeky hare. ‘This is your third 
mistake, young hare. It was your idea that the loser should cook the meal, and now you are 
trying to get out of this commitment. I am the referee and this will not be tolerated.’

All of the animals agreed that the hare was being very cheeky in trying to get out of his 
promise. He had lost the race and he should be the one to cook the meal.

When the wise owl pointed out that the hare had been arrogant and irresponsible, and was 
even now trying to break his promise, the young hare became so embarrassed that he lowered 
his eyes to the ground and used his long, floppy ears to cover his face.

But the wise owl insisted that the hare cook the meal and invite the tortoise and the 
parrot and all of the animals of the forest.

The hare reluctantly agreed to cook the meal, and it was during this long process of 
cooking that the hare learned his lesson. He told himself that he would never again 
be so lazy and conceited. And he would never, ever, underestimate the talents of his friends.

That night, the owl, the parrot, the tortoise, and all the other animals of the forest, 
enjoyed the wonderful meal that the hare had cooked for them. The friends talked and 
laughed and ate, and the hare even congratulated the tortoise on his victory in the race!</p>
