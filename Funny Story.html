        Engineers Problem in Testing

Once engineers at one of major aerospace company were 
testing the effects of bird strikes on the wind shield 
on various jets and airliners.

So to stimulate the effect of a bird striking a traveling 
plane at high speed engineers decided to make a powerful gun 
with which they could fire dead chicken (from freezer) at 
the wind shields.

After some test engineers declared that the test was very 
successful and the stimulation they used with gun and dead 
chicken worked very effectively.

Many articles and projects were published related to the suitability 
of wind shields and test done to approve that windshields were now 
suitable for planes.

At the same time in other part of world some other scientists were 
trying to assess same thing but on windshields of very new high train 
speeds.

These train test engineers had heard about the pioneering test developed 
by aerospace team, so they approached them and asked proper specifications 
of the test and way to conduct that test and the gun and dead bird.

Aerospace test engineers were happy to provide with all the details related 
to test done on wind shield.

Now train engineers were all set to build their own stimulation of bird 
striking high speed train But when tests were done results were shocking.

Wind shields that were supposed to be of high resistance to bird strike 
were smashed into pieces. In fact every single windshield they tired for 
testing was shattered along with the test booth itself.

Train engineers were horrified and concerned about the new high speed train 
safety and technology so they went to aerospace engineer with long report of 
failure of test and asked for advice and suggestions.

After reading the report a brief reply was sent from aerospace company test 
engineers and that was..

You Need to Defrost the Chickens First…

Moral:
Sometimes we work hard and focus on important thing but forget to notice small 
things that we over look because of pressure and work. So we need to sit and 
think for little and we can find solution.

            Engineer Vs Manager

            Once a man was flying high in hot air balloon and 
            realized that he is lost. He reduced height of his 
            hot air balloon to see if he can find someone. At a 
            distance he saw a man down below.
            
            Seeing that man, he lowered his balloon more near the ground level 
            and shouted, “Excuse me, can you help me?? I had promised my friend 
            to reach his place half hour ago but now i don’t know where i am going.”
            
            Man standing below replied, “Yes. I can help. I see that you are in 
            hot air balloon, approximately 30 feet above ground. You positioning 
            is about 40 degree latitude and 60 degree longitude.”
            
            Man in balloon interrupted and questioned, “You must be an engineer..??”
            
            Man on ground replied, “Yes. I am but how do you know?”
            
            Man in balloon replied with a smirk on his face, “Well. Everything 
            you said was technically correct but i don’t know what to do with 
            that information as it not going to get me know how i can find my 
            way. More over Fact is that i am still lost.”
            
            Man below questioned, “You must be a Manager..”
            
            Man in balloon was surprised and said, “Well. Yes i am but how 
            do you know that i am a manager?”
            
            Man on ground replied, “See.. You were lost. You don’t know 
            where you are and where you going. You made a promise that you 
            have no idea how to keep.
            
            Now when you need help and you expect me solve your problem. The 
            fact was that you were lost and you are still lost But now it is 
            Somehow my Fault..”</p>

        <h2>Secret Behind the Door</h2>

        <p style="font-size: large; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
            Secret Behind the Door

            It was night time, a man was driving down the road and his car breaks 
            down near monastery. Because of night time he goes to monastery and 
            knocks on door. As monk came outside and open the door, man says, 
            “My car broke down. Can i stay here for a night?”
            
            Monk accepted his request. Monks not only let him stay but also feed 
            him and even fixed his car. As man tried to fell asleep, he heard a 
            strange sound. Next morning he asked monk about that sound but monk 
            said, “We can’t tell you that because you are not a monk.”
            
            Man felt disappointed but thank them and left on his way.
            
            After some years, same man car breaks down in front of same monastery. 
            Everything happened same as before. Monks accepted him and feed him 
            and fixed his car.
            
            This time when man went to sleep even this time he hears same strange 
            noise that he had heard earlier. Next morning he asks monk about that 
            noise but monk replied same, “We can’t tell you because you are not monk.”
            
            Man said, “All right. i want to know what reason for that sound if 
            only to find out about it is to become a monk, then tell me how can 
            I become a monk?”
            
            Monk replied, “If you want to become a monk then you have to travel 
            the earth and tell us the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find 
            this, you will become a monk.”
            
            Man set for this task and Forty years later he returns and knocks on 
            door of monastery and said, “I have traveled the whole earth and i have 
            found that there are 222,345,323,954,110,958,203 sand pebbles on earth.”
            
            Monk congrats the man and said, “Now we shall show you the way to the 
            sound.”
            
            Man was happy as monk lead him towards a wooden door and said, “Sound 
            you looking for is right behind that door.”
            
            Man reaches for the knob to open the door but found out that door was 
            locked. So he requested monk to give him the key to open the door. Monk 
            gave him the key.
            
            Man opens the door and behind that door he saw another door made of 
            stone. Again man saw that the door was locked so he asked for key to 
            that door.
            
            As man opened stone door he find another door made of gold and it was 
            also locked. Monk gave him key to that door also. Again there was another 
            door made of ruby. This goes on until he had to go through another 
            series of door.
            
            Finally monk said, “This the last door and here is key to this door.”
            
            Man was at last relieved and he unlocks the door, turns the knob 
            and he was amazed to find the source of sound behind that door
            
            But I can’t tell you what it is.. Because you are not a Monk.</p>
