        <h2>How long can you keep hatred in your heart</h2>

        A kindergarten teacher had decided to let her class play a game. 
        The teacher told each child in the class to bring along a plastic 
        bag containing a few potatoes. Each potato will be given a name of a 
        person that the child hates. So the number of potatoes that a child 
        will put in his/her plastic bag will depend on the number of people 
        he/she hates. 
        
        So when the day came, every child brought some potatoes with the name 
        of the people he/she hated. Some had 2 potatoes, some 3 while some up 
        to 5 potatoes. The teacher then told the children to carry the potatoes 
        in the plastic bag with them wherever they go for 1 week. Days after days 
        passed, and the children started to complain due to the unpleasant smell 
        let out by the rotten potatoes. Besides, those having 5 potatoes also had 
        to carry heavier bags. After 1 week, the children were relieved because the 
        game had finally ended. 
        
        The teacher asked: “How did you feel while carrying the potatoes with you 
        for 1 week?” The children let out their frustrations and started complaining 
        of the trouble that they had to go through having to carry the heavy and 
        smelly potatoes wherever they go. 
        
        Then the teacher told them the hidden meaning behind the game. The teacher 
        said: “This is exactly the situation when you carry your hatred for somebody 
        inside your heart. The stench of hatred will contaminate your heart and you 
        will carry it with you wherever you go. If you cannot tolerate the smell of 
        rotten potatoes for just 1 week, can you imagine what is it like to have the 
        stench of hatred in your heart for your lifetime?” 
        
        Moral: Throw away any hatred for anyone from your heart so that you will not 
        carry burden for a lifetime. Forgiving others is the best attitude to take. 
        Negativity about someone will keep peace of your mind away from you. Remember 
        the good things about him/her, and let go of the hatred.

            Think Before You Judge

A doctor entered the hospital in hurry after being called in for an 
urgent surgery. He answered the call asap, changed his clothes and 
went directly to the surgery block. He found the boy’s father pacing 
in the hall waiting for the doctor. 

On seeing him, the father yelled, “Why did you take all this time 
to come? Don’t you know that my son’s life is in danger? Don’t 
you have any sense of responsibility?” 

The doctor smiled and said, “I am sorry, I wasn’t in the hospital 
and I came as fast as I could after receiving the call and now, I 
wish you’d calm down so that I can do my work”. 

“Calm down?! What if your son was in this room right now, would you 
calm down? If your own son dies while waiting for doctor than what 
will you do??” said the father angrily. The doctor smiled again and 
replied, “We will do our best by God’s grace and you should also pray 
for your son’s healthy life”. 
“Giving advises when we’re not concerned is so easy” Murmured the father. 

The surgery took some hours after which the doctor went out happy, “Thank 
goodness! your son is saved!” And without waiting for the father’s reply 
he carried on his way running by saying, “If you have any questions, ask 
the nurse”. 

“Why is he so arrogant? He couldn’t wait some minutes so that I ask about 
my son’s state” Commented the father when seeing the nurse minutes after 
the doctor left. The nurse answered, tears coming down her face, “His son 
died yesterday in a road accident, he was at the burial when we called him 
for your son’s surgery. And now that he saved your son’s life, he left 
running to finish his son’s burial.” 

Moral: Never judge anyone because you never know how their life is and 
what they’re going through.</p>

            The Wise Old Man

A wealthy man requested an old scholar to wean his son away from his bad 
habits. The scholar took the youth for a stroll through a garden. 
Stopping suddenly he asked the boy to pull out a tiny plant growing there. 

The youth held the plant between his thumb and forefinger and pulled 
it out. The old man then asked him to pull out a slightly bigger plant. 
The youth pulled hard and the plant came out, roots and all. “Now pull 
out that one,” said the old man pointing to a bush. The boy had to use 
all his strength to pull it out. 
“Now take this one out,” said the old man, indicating a guava tree. 
The youth grasped the trunk and tried to pull it out. But it would 
not budge. “It’s impossible,” said the boy, panting with the effort. 

“So it is with bad habits,” said the sage. “When they are young it is 
easy to pull them out but when they take hold they cannot be uprooted.” 

The session with the old man changed the boy’s life. 
 
Moral: Don’t wait for Bad Habits to grow in you, drop them while you have control 
over it else they will get control you.</p>
